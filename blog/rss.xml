            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi there — I’m so glad you’ve found your way here. This site is both a user guide for TūlBOX, a growing collection of automation tools, and a living knowledge base for topics in music publishing, royalty collection, and the business of rights management.</p>
<p>A little about me: my background is in math and computer science — not music publishing. Like many who end up working behind the scenes in entertainment, I’ve had to pick up a lot on the fly. As I learn the ins and outs of music publishing on the job, I’ve been organizing what I’ve found helpful, confusing, or just worth remembering into notes, guides, and tools — and adding them here.</p>
<p>Whether you’re new to music publishing, trying to automate a few tedious workflows, or just curious about how it all fits together, I hope this site helps make things a bit clearer.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>]]></content:encoded>
