Excited to announce the release of the **Cue Sheet Converter** in TūlBOX — a fast, in-browser tool for extracting and formatting music cue sheet data.

## What it does

The Cue Sheet Converter takes raw cue sheet files (**PDF**) and transforms them into clean, structured data for easy review and downstream use.

No more manually scanning PDF files line-by-line — the converter parses the file automatically and outputs a neatly organized table view.

## Key features

- **Drag-and-drop upload** for quick file selection
- **Automatic parsing** of Soundmouse-formatted cue sheets
- **Table view** for instant preview of extracted data
- **Column metadata mapping** for consistent exports
- **Warnings** for missing or unexpected data
- **One-click CSV download** for reporting or archiving

## How it works

1. Upload your cue sheet file.
2. The converter scans for titles, writers, publishers, durations, and other key fields.
3. Data preview is displayed directly in your browser.
4. Export to CSV — no server processing, so your files stay local and secure.

## Why it matters

This tool **alleviates** the tedious PDF-scanning process and reduces the risk of typos or missed metadata.  
It’s especially valuable when linking episodes across **high volumes of cue sheets**.

## What’s next

- **More formats:** RapidCue and CueSpark support are planned for upcoming releases.
