Excited to announce the release of the **Cue Sheet Converter** in TūlBOX — a fast, in-browser tool for extracting and formatting music cue sheet data.

## What it does

The Cue Sheet Converter takes raw cue sheet files (**PDF**) and transforms them into clean, structured data for easy review and downstream use.

This reduces manual scanning pdf files line-by-line — the converter parses the file automatically and outputs a neatly organized table view.

## Key features

- **Drag-and-drop upload** for quick file selection
- **Automatic parsing** of Soundmouse-formatted cue sheets
- **Table view** for a quick preview of the extracted data
- **Column metadata mapping** for consistent exports
- **Warnings** to notify you of missing or unexpected data
- **Copy or download** results in CSV format for reporting or archiving

## How it works

1. Upload your cue sheet file
2. The converter scans for titles, writers, publishers, durations, and other key fields
3. Data is displayed in an table inside your browser
4. Export as needed — no server processing, so your files stay local

## Why it matters

This tool removes the tedious manual entry step and reduces the risk of typos or mismatched metadata. It’s especially useful for episode linking with high volumes of cue sheets.

## What’s next

- **More formats:** RapidCue and CueSpark files
