**Minor Update – Improved Tables, Accessibility, and AKAs**

This is quick note on a few quality-of-life updates to keep your TūlBOX workflow smooth and efficient.

**Sortable Tables**
- The file table in PDF Manager and the AKA tables in Production Search are now fully sortable. Quickly reorganize data to find exactly what you need.  

**Expanded AKA Results**
- The AKA limit in Production Search has been increased from 30 to 100.  

**Accessibility Enhancements**
- Production Search results and details now support tabbing and full keyboard navigation. You can move through results, open details, and even copy values — all without leaving the keyboard.

These small but impactful changes should make searching, sorting, and navigating TūlBOX faster and more inclusive.
