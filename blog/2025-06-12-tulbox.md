## ðŸš€ TuÌ„lBOX v3 is Live!

I'm excited to announce that **TuÌ„lBOX v3** is officially live!

This release brings a smoother experience, sharper performance, and improved APIs. The existing tools have been refined based on feedback from real-world use and the entire app has been rebuilt from the ground up. It is now ready to host additional tools as they get released!

### âœ… Whatâ€™s New in v3

* **Improved Speed** â€“ Apps load faster and respond more smoothly.
* **Cleaner UI** â€“ I redesigned the tools for clarity and flexibility.
* **More Reliable Automation** â€“ Updated back-end pipelines to handle complex files more gracefully.
* **Better Metadata Handling** â€“ The IMDb tool has a custom built API.

### ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

This update makes it easier to add new tools that are in the works, such as CWR conversion and automated cue sheet stamping.

This is a 00 release, so there will be blood! I mean bugs. Reach out if you run into anything weird.
