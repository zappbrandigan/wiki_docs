### Production Search Tool Update: Country of Origin + Copy-Paste Fixes

Here is quick update about some recent changes to the Production Search tool on TūlBOX! This update focuses on improving data clarity and fixing some annoying copy-paste quirks. Here’s what’s new:

#### Country of Origin Now Included

You can now see the country of origin listed alongside each title. This makes it easier to distinguish between international versions of a film or series at a glance—especially helpful for teams handling global metadata.

#### Alternative Titles Copy-Paste Fix

Previously, copying alternative titles would result in the order being scrambled or inconsistent. That’s now fixed. The tool preserves the display order exactly as shown when copying, so what you see is what you get.

#### IMDb Code Copy Trimmed to Last 9 Characters

I've cleaned up the IMDb code copy behavior. Instead of copying the full URL or extra characters, it now smartly copies just the last 9-character IMDb ID (e.g.,tt12345678 -> t12345678)—perfect for pasting into internal systems. (This change may be reverted in the future.)
