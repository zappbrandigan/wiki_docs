**✨ UI Improvements**

Small design tweaks across the app improve clarity and consistency. Buttons, spacing, and layout adjustments should make everything feel smoother without changing your workflow.

**⌨️ Navigation Hotkeys**

You can now jump directly to your favorite tools using keyboard shortcuts. No more clicking through menus—navigate instantly.

**🔗 Direct URLs with React Router**

Tools now have direct URLs! That means you can bookmark or share links to specific tools, and load them directly without going through the homepage.

**🏠 New Home & Info Page**

Added a new landing page that highlights recent updates and provides a product roadmap.

These updates make TūlBOX more seamless for both new and power users. More refinements are on the way—stay tuned!
