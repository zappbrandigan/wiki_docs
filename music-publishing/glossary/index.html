<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a">A<a href="#a" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A" title="Direct link to A">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Administration</strong> -
The practice and process of business functions relating to individual compositions or a catalog of compositions. This includes registering works with collection societies, registering copyrights, issuing licenses directly or via a collection society or agent on behalf of the copyright owner, collecting and distributing fees and royalties, and all other responsibilities that relate to the use of a musical work and/or sound recording.</p>
<p><strong>Administration Agreement (Deal)</strong> -
A partnership deal in which a songwriter contracts with a publishing administrator. In this arrangement, the songwriter keeps 100 percent ownership of the copyright and pays an administrative fee to the publisher/administrator. The administrator usually provides limited or no creative services.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator</strong> -
A professional who supervises finances and copyright matters for a song or catalog. An administrator’s primary role is to protect song copyrights, collect royalties, issue licenses, and ensure that songwriters are paid properly. All major publishers and most independents handle administration for the catalogs they own and control internally. Smaller publishers and many individual songwriters who don’t want to give up their copyrights sign deals with companies that focus exclusively on providing administration services without taking an ownership interest.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliation</strong> -
Affiliation means becoming a member of an organization or society and granting them a number of rights and responsibilities regarding writers&#x27; works. These include licensing, tracking, and protecting usage of songs, authorizing other societies through reciprocal agreements, licensing rights to songs on behalf of the writers, and accounting for and paying royalties out to the songwriter.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="b">B<a href="#b" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to B" title="Direct link to B">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Blanket License</strong> -
A license issued by a rights holder or their representative that provides for use of their entire catalog for a predetermined period of time. Examples of blanket licenses include those signed by digital service providers like Spotify with performing and mechanical rights organizations.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="c">C<a href="#c" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to C" title="Direct link to C">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Co-Publishing Agreement</strong> -
A publishing agreement in which a songwriter assigns a certain percentage of their copyright to a publishing company in exchange for creative and administrative services. Songwriters are often paid an advance under these agreements.</p>
<p><strong>Co-Writer</strong> - Any person who contributes to a composition along with you. (A co-writer may be a songwriting collaborator a writer works with in the studio, but also could be the original writer of a song that is sampled.)</p>
<p><strong>Collection Societies</strong> - Collection societies are organizations that protect, register, license, and collect royalties for their members’ works. The most commonly known types of collection societies are PROs (performing rights organizations), CMOs (collective management organization), and MROs (mechanical rights organization). When a writer joins a collection society, the writer is giving them the right and responsibility to track the usage of their works for their rights types, account for them, and pay the writer accordingly. Collection societies are a key pay source, but not all pay sources are collection societies.</p>
<p><strong>Collective Management Organizations (CMOs)</strong> -
These non-profit organizations are responsible
for licensing, tracking, and collecting publishing royalties earned, and then paying them out to the respective songwriters and/or publishers. CMOs generally have an open and non-discriminatory criteria to join, are owned by its members, and typically need legal authorization to operate. Each CMO operates within a specific country or territory and may vary in the type of royalties they
collect.</p>
<p><strong>Commission</strong> - In this context, commission is the percentage an administrator retains of royalties collected before paying them out to their client. Commissions are the primary - and sometimes only - way in which administrators are paid for their work on a client’s catalog.</p>
<p><strong>Composition</strong> - The elements that make a specific song (not a specific recording) unique, such as melody, lyrics, and beat. A composition can have many recordings.</p>
<p><strong>Compulsory License</strong> - An exception to U.S. copyright law that grants permission to anyone wishing to use a songwriter’s work - whether the songwriter wants to grant the license - if the song has already been commercially released. Compulsory licenses must be issued for physical reproductions of a song (such as an LP, CD, or digital download), streaming a song, for use in cable television rebroadcast, on the Public Broadcasting System (PBS), or in jukeboxes.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright</strong> - The rights granted by law to the creator of an original work. A creator (e.g., a songwriter or author) is entitled to the right to copy, distribute, and adapt their work. Under U.S. copyright law, as soon as a writer makes a tangible copy of a work, the writer owns its copyright. Put another way, if you imagine a song in your head, you have no copyright—but once you write the song down or record it, you are its copyright holder.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright Act</strong> - The Copyright Act of 1976 is a United States law spelling out the basic rights of copyright holders. It codifies the doctrine of “fair use,” and adopts for most new copyrights a unitary term based on the date of the author’s death rather than the prior scheme of fixed initial and renewal terms. It protects musical works including songs and any accompanying words as well as orchestral works, librettos, and other musical compositions. A separate copyright protects individual recordings of musical compositions.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright Registration</strong> - A record stating the date of a work and its content so that in the event of infringement or plagiarism, the copyright owner can produce a copy of the work from an official source.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright Royalty Board (CRB)</strong> - The CRB consists of three U.S. judges who are responsible for setting statutory royalty rates for compulsory mechanical licenses. This board periodically sets the statutory mechanical royalty rate, which for physical and download track sales is currently 9.1 cents per track or 1.75 cents for each minute of playing time, whichever is greater. Visit the <a href="https://www.crb.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copyright Royalty Board website</a> for more.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="d">D<a href="#d" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to D" title="Direct link to D">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Digital Service Providers (DSP)</strong> - A Digital Service Provider (DSP) is an entity that provides digital music services (whether streaming, downloads, or both), via computer or phone networks. DSPs tend to focus on driving almost all interactions online and across devices. Examples are Apple Music and Spotify.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="e">E<a href="#e" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to E" title="Direct link to E">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Exclusive Songwriter Agreement (“Staff Writer” Contract)</strong> - A contract with a publishing company in which a songwriter assigns the entire publisher’s share of any songs written during the term of the agreement to the publishing company. In return, the songwriter receives advances on a regular basis (similar to being paid a salary), which are then generally subject to recoupment by the publishing company.</p>
<p><strong>Exploitation</strong> - In this context, “exploit” means to monetize a music composition. Releasing a recording of a song in physical or digital form, issuing a sync license for use of a song in a TV show, and licensing a song to DSPs or radio stations, are all examples of exploiting a work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="f">F<a href="#f" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to F" title="Direct link to F">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Fair Use</strong> - An exception to the exclusive rights granted to the copyright holder of a creative work. If something falls under the doctrine of “fair use,” another party can use the copyrighted material in a limited way without acquiring permission from the rights holder. In certain situations, parody, commentary, search engines, criticism, news reporting, research, teaching, library archiving, and scholarship may be considered fair use.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i">I<a href="#i" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to I" title="Direct link to I">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong> - Any conceptual product that has commercial value. This includes any form of creative expression and knowledge (such as symbols, names, and images), whether copyrighted or not. Intellectual property can be protected through copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets laws. For example, Nike’s signature checkmark logo is protected through trademark, and Coca-Cola’s secret recipe for Coke is protected through trade secrets law. Visit the <a href="https://www.wipo.int" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Intellectual Property Organization</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Interactive/Non-Interactive Streaming</strong> - Interactive or “on-demand” streaming services (like Spotify, Tidal, or Apple Music) allow listeners to choose what recordings they listen to, and they generate both performance and mechanical royalties. Non-interactive streaming services (notably Pandora) - sometimes loosely referred to as streaming radio - in which the listener does not choose the specific songs, pay only performance royalties.</p>
<p><strong>Interested Parties Information (IPI)</strong> - A nine-digit number used to uniquely identify a songwriter or publisher. The IPI database replaced the CAE database as the industry standard in 2001, but the two are often used interchangeably. There are a few CMOs that assign their songwriters both an IPI and a CAE. Rightsholders are assigned IPI numbers when they’re granted membership to a PRO.</p>
<p><strong>International Standard Recording Code (ISRC)</strong> - A 12-character alphanumeric code used to identify a unique sound recording. One song can have multiple ISRCs if the song has been recorded, remixed, or edited more than once. Publishers, collection societies, and music services use ISRCs to match master recordings to underlying compositions. ISRCs are typically assigned by labels or distributors. An ISRC looks like this: <code>US-S1Z-99-00001</code>.</p>
<p><strong>International Standard Work Code (ISWC)</strong> - An 11-character alphanumeric code used to identify a unique musical composition. A song only has one ISWC, but arrangements, adaptations, and translations should receive their own unique ISWCs, as they represent new works and often have new songwriter share splits. ISWCs are issued by collection societies upon work registration. An ISWC looks like this: <code>T-123.456.789-Z</code>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="l">L<a href="#l" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to L" title="Direct link to L">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Letter of Direction (LOD)</strong> - The formal notice to a collection society that a publisher will be taking administrative control of a songwriter’s catalog on that songwriter’s behalf.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="m">M<a href="#m" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to M" title="Direct link to M">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Mechanical License</strong> - A mechanical license is granted by a rightsholder to a licensee that enables them to reproduce (digitally or physically) an original composition.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Licensing Collective (The MLC)</strong> - The MLC is responsible for providing blanket licenses to all streaming services in the U.S., and to collect and distribute all resulting royalties.  The MLC’s remit is to attempt actively to match as many unmatched royalties and compositions with the correct rights holders as possible, and in that connection, it is responsible for creating and maintaining a publicly-accessible database of works, songwriters, rights holders, and related recordings. The MLC was established as part of 2018&#x27;s Music Modernization Act.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Rights Organization (MRO)</strong> – A type of collection society that is responsible for the administration of mechanical licenses and, depending on the MRO, the collection and payout of mechanical royalties to publishers. Oftentimes, if a territory or country does not have a single CMO responsible for both performance and mechanical royalty collections, they split these responsibilities between a PRO and a MRO.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Royalties</strong> - Royalties earned through the reproduction of copyrighted works in digital and physical formats. Songwriters are paid mechanical royalties per song sold, downloaded, and streamed via “on-demand” streaming services.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Rights</strong> - The rights to reproduce and distribute copyrighted musical compositions (songs) on CDs, records, tapes, ringtones, permanent digital downloads, interactive streams, and other digital configurations supporting various business models, including locker-based music services and bundled music offerings. Mechanical rights are obtained via mechanical licenses.</p>
<p><strong>Micro-Sync Royalties</strong> - Royalties earned by the synchronization of music with moving images in online platforms like YouTube or TikTok, including user-generated videos. Depending on the platform, these uses usually generate both performance and mechanical royalties, as well as additional revenues for the video creator/uploader and the recording owner.</p>
<p><strong>Music Modernization Act (MMA)</strong> - A major piece of U.S. music business legislation passed in 2018, the MMA is intended to improve the financial landscape for artists, songwriters, and publishers through updates to the regulations around royalties from online streaming services and other outlets. One major piece of the MMA was the creation of The Mechanical Licensing Collective (The MLC).</p>
<p><strong>Music Publishing</strong> - The business of acquiring, protecting, and promoting song (composition) copyrights and collecting the royalties that these copyrights generate. Music publishing ensures that songwriters get paid fairly when their intellectual property—their musical works—are used by companies such as record labels (which pay mechanical royalties); radio stations, bars, and restaurants (which pay performance royalties); or film studios and advertising agencies (which pay sync license fees), among others. Music publishing pays royalties only to the writer of a song, not to performing artists or recording owners.</p>

<p><strong>Neighboring Rights</strong> - The public performance right associated with a recording copyright. Also called “related rights,” neighboring rights are similar to the public performance rights associated with compositions, but they are paid to recording owners (usually labels) and performing artists, rather than songwriters and publishers. In the U.S., this is called a “digital performance” right and is only recognized for non-interactive digital transmissions, such as satellite and digital radio (e.g., Sirius XM and Pandora) - notably not for broadcast radio.</p>
<p><strong>Notice of Intention (NOI)</strong> – A legal document, pertaining to Section 115 of the U.S. Copyright Act, that is required to record or distribute someone else’s original composition. Sending an NOI to the original copyright owner of the composition is necessary in obtaining a compulsory mechanical license.</p>

<p><strong>Pay Source</strong> – A pay source is a general term to identify any rights organization, collection society, or digital service provider that pays out royalties earned for the use of a song.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Royalties</strong> - Royalties collected when a composition is broadcast (e.g. on the radio) or publicly performed (e.g. live in concert or over the speakers at a nightclub). Performance royalties are collected by performing rights organizations such as ASCAP in the U.S., and by PROs or collective management organizations, such as SACEM in France.</p>
<p><strong>Performing Rights Organization (PRO)</strong> - PROs are responsible for collecting income on behalf of songwriters and music publishers when a song is publicly broadcast or performed. Public performances can include play on television or radio, in clubs and restaurants, on websites, or on other broadcasting systems. PROs collect license fees for this usage which they pay to their registered songwriters after taking a small fee.</p>
<p><strong>Printed Music Royalties</strong> - Royalties collected for the sale of printed sheet music, including musical notation and lyrics, separately or in combination. Printed music royalties are generally paid directly to the publisher and will vary depending on the usage type and whether it’s a physical or digital reproduction.</p>
<p><strong>Public Performance</strong> - Public performance includes transmission or broadcast of a work outside a closed group, and includes digital streaming, television or radio broadcast, played over the speakers in clubs and restaurants, on websites, or on other broadcasting systems.</p>
<p><strong>Publisher Share</strong> - The publisher share, or “publisher’s share of performance,” is the portion of performance royalties that is paid over to a publisher, publishing administrator, or to the songwriter if they are self-published. It is distinguished in this way from the writer share.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing Administrator</strong> - A third-party publisher that for a fixed term controls all licensing and the collection of publishing revenue streams on behalf of a composer or copyright owner.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing Agreement</strong> - A legal contract between a composer/lyricist/author/songwriter and a publisher.</p>

<p><strong>Retroactive Royalties</strong> - Retroactive royalties are unallocated royalties that are waiting to be paid out to the copyright owners. This happens when songs aren’t registered correctly or the contact information for the songwriter is unavailable. These royalties generally sit at the collection society for a length of time, which varies based on the society, until they enter the black box. Refer to unallocated royalties for more.</p>
<p><strong>Rights Administration Entity (RAE)</strong> - RAEs are a type of organization that issues mechanical licenses and collects and distributes mechanical royalties. Unlike CMOs, RAEs are for-profit organizations, they can discriminate as to whom they accept as members, and do not need legal permission to operate as they are privately-owned. An example in the U.S. is Music Reports (MRI).</p>
<p><strong>Royalties</strong> - Payments made on a per-use or blanket basis as established by a license agreement. In the context of music publishing, royalties refer to the income earned through the use of a song. This can include album sales, digital downloads, streams, radio airplay, and a host of other forms through which songs earn income for songwriters and music publishers.</p>

<p><strong>Sampling</strong> - The act of taking material from a previously existing sound recording and incorporating it into an entirely new sound recording and composition. Sampling began as a technique used by experimental composers but became a popular production technique in early hip-hop, and was later adopted by almost all other popular music genres. In order to use a sample legally, you must come to a legal agreement with the composition owner as well as the sound recording owner.</p>
<p><strong>Songwriter</strong> - A songwriter is anyone who creates any part of a musical composition - whether it’s the lyrics, beat, underlying melody, chorus, hook, or other element.</p>
<p><strong>Split Sheet</strong> - A signed document that outlines the shares of an individual musical work each co-writer will control. A split agreement should be finalized between collaborators before it is exploited commercially in any way, including commercial release to streaming services.</p>
<p><strong>Sync License</strong> - An agreement for the use of music in an audiovisual project. Sync (short for “synchronization”) licenses must be obtained from both the composition rights holder and the recording rights holder to clear a usage.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. Copyright Office</strong> - The U.S. government body that maintains records of copyright registration. A work is technically copyrighted once it’s in tangible form, but registering it with the U.S. copyright office is an additional way to protect its copyright. In order to file an infringement action (i.e., to recover damages or stop someone from using a writers&#x27; copyright without permission), the work needs to be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office. Visit <a href="https://copyright.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">copyright.gov</a> for more.</p>
<p><strong>Unallocated Royalties</strong> – Sometimes called “black box” or &quot;suspense&quot; royalties, these are royalties for which a publisher or writer is named but cannot be traced by a pay source. Writers who earn royalties for usage but cannot be found are often referred to as “lost” writers. After an established waiting period, these royalties are no longer payable and are generally distributed by top earners by market share.</p>
<p><strong>User-Generated Content (UGC)</strong> - User-generated content, or “UGC,” in the context of song rights, refers to content created by a platform’s users (e.g. YouTube or TikTok) that contains copyrighted music. This is often unlicensed or subject to a blanket use license between the platform and the rights holder.</p>

<p><strong>Work-For-Hire</strong> - In this context, an agreement in which a songwriter composes a musical work within the scope of their employment for another entity and does not retain copyright or publishing ownership over the work. Work-for-hire agreements are common in film, TV, and advertising, in which production companies often hire composers to create music specifically for their projects. Instead of receiving an initial fee and subsequent royalties, a work-for-hire creator receives only a one-time up-front fee for their work.</p>
<p><strong>Writer Share</strong> - The writer share, or “writer’s share of performance,” is the portion of performance royalties that is paid directly to a songwriter, whether they have a publisher. It is distinguished in this way from the publisher share.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-doc-footer-tags-row"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/glossary">glossary</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/tags/definitions">definitions</a></li></ul></div></div></footer></article><nav class="docusaurus-mt-lg pagination-nav" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Welcome!</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/film-tv"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Film and TV Admin Highlights</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#a" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">A</a></li><li><a href="#b" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">B</a></li><li><a href="#c" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">C</a></li><li><a href="#d" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">D</a></li><li><a href="#e" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">E</a></li><li><a href="#f" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">F</a></li><li><a href="#i" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">I</a></li><li><a href="#l" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">L</a></li><li><a href="#m" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">M</a></li><li><a href="#n" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">N</a></li><li><a href="#p" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">P</a></li><li><a href="#r" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">R</a></li><li><a href="#s" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">S</a></li><li><a href="#u" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">U</a></li><li><a href="#w" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">W</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="theme-layout-footer footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/">Wiki</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/tulbox/intro">Documentation</a></li></ul></div><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://docusaurus.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Docusaurus<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://tulbox.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">TūlBOX<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Updates</a></li></ul></div></div></div></footer></div>
