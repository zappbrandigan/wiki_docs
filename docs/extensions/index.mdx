import ExtensionsList from '@site/src/components/ExtensionsList';

This page lists all browser extensions created by TūlBOX. Each extension is designed to support specific internal workflows and utilities and is maintained as part of the broader TūlBOX toolset.

All extensions on this page can be downloaded directly and are intended to be installed using the browser's “Load unpacked” method. 

These extensions are distributed as unpacked builds to allow for rapid iteration, transparency, and internal use without requiring publication to a public extension marketplace.
Refer to each extension's entry below for a brief description, intended use case, and download link.
