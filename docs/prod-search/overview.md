# Production Search – Quick Start

The **Production Search** tool lets you look up films, series, episodes, and video games and explore rich metadata—without leaving TūlBOX.

## Workflow

1. **Choose a type**
   Use the toggle (**All / Movies / TV Shows / Games**) above the search bar. Selecting a type narrows the results to that category. Leaving it on **All** performs a global search; you can always re‑filter the results afterwards with the same toggle.

:::tip

To narrow search results, set the filter **before** you click *Search*—that way the API only returns the data you need.

:::

2. **Search**
   Enter a title, keyword, or **IMDb ID** (`tt1234567`) and press **Enter** or click **Search**.

3. **Browse & drill down**
   Click any card to open a detail pane showing:  
   • Cast & crew with roles  
   • Plot synopsis & runtime  
   • Ratings & production companies  
   • International titles (AKA) with automatic transliteration/language tags  

:::note

International titles appear in Romanized transliteration for easy copy‑paste.

4. **Copy anything**
   Click any field—or an entire AKA row—to copy its value to your clipboard. No tedious text selection required.

5. **Open on IMDb**
   Use the **IMDb** link to jump to the official page in a new tab whenever you need deeper research.
