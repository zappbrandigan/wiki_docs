This page lists all Excel scripts maintained in the shared Excel automation repository. Each entry corresponds to a folder in the `out` directory and includes a brief description along with a download link for the script file.

These scripts are intended for internal workflows and are distributed directly from the repository for quick iteration and transparency. Refer to each script's entry below for a summary and the download file.
