## Overview of Status Indicators.

1. General indicators:
    - `Valid` indicates that there are no invalid characters present in your filename.
    - `Invalid` indicates that the filename has characters that are not allowed.
    - `Duplicate` indicates that there are multiple files with the same name.
2. Cue sheet quick template indicators:
    - `Error` indicates that your filename could not be processed using the template (e.g. the 3/2 space delimiters are not present). It will attempt to process the files if these delimiters are not present, but, in general, nothing will change.
    - `Dotified` indicates that the filename has been conformed to the specific 60 character limit for this cue sheet naming convention.
    - `Modified` indicates that the filename is has been changed from its original value. This can happen if the title doesn't need to be shortened but other changes, such as article moving or whitespace removal, have been made.
