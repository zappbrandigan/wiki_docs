The PDF Manager helps you organize and rename your PDF files quickly and easily.

**How to use:**
1. **Upload Files:** Drag and drop your PDF files into the upload area, or click to select files from your computer. Only PDF files are accepted.
    - Maximum file count for upload is set to 100 PDFs; this is not a system limitation, just a practical decision as changes tend to have unintentionaly effects when dealing in large volume. If you need this limit to be increased, reach out GitHub.
2. **View & Edit:** See your files in a table. You can edit file names directly by clicking the edit icon next to each name.
3. **Batch Rename:** Use the "Search & Replace" section to create rules for renaming files in bulk. You can use regular expressions for advanced patterns. Click "Apply Rules" to update all file names at once.
    - Rules can be changed together and are applied sequentially.
4. **Check Status:** The table highlights duplicates and invalid names. Only files marked as "Valid" can be downloaded.
:::warning

This tool is not enforcing file name conventions at this time; this feature will be implemented soon.

5. **Download:** Click "Download All" to save all valid, renamed files to your computer.
