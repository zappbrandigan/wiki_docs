# CWR Converter â€“ Quick Start

Turn raw **Common Works Registration** (CWRÂ v2.1Â /Â v2.2) files into humanâ€‘readable tables and custom reportsâ€”all inside your browser.

---

## 1Â Â·Â Upload a CWR file

* Dragâ€‘andâ€‘drop or **Browse** for a `.v21` or `.v22` file (up to \~150Â MB).
* The parser validates the header and record structure before rendering.

> **Headsâ€‘up:** Very large files parse synchronouslyâ€”keep the tab in focus to avoid throttling.

:::warning >150Mb

All processing happens entirely in your browser, so your data never leaves your machine. Because everything runs locally, the maximum file size the tool can handle depends on your computerâ€™s memory and processing power. A typical work-issued PC can handle ~120-150Mb. If you have files larger than this, reach out, or download the CLI version.

## 2Â Â·Â Explore in **Raw Viewer**

| Feature                 | What it does                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fieldâ€‘info tooltips** | Hover any cell to see the CWR spec name, length, and description. Toggle on/off in the toolbar.                   |
| **Fullâ€‘screen mode**    | Click **Maximise** to dedicate the full viewport to the raw gridâ€”ideal for multiâ€‘monitor setups.                  |
| **Global search**       | Find any text across *all* records (supports RegExp). Matches are highlighted and the grid scrolls automatically. |
| **Lazy rendering**      | Rows are virtualized, so even 100kâ€‘line files stay snappy.                                                        |

## 3Â Â·Â Generate a report

1. Open the **Report Generator** panel.
2. Pick a **template** (e.g. *ISRC Report*, *Batch Report*, *Cat Import*). Templates are versioned and updated automatically.
3. **Runs Automatically** â€“ the tool walks the CWR hierarchy and flattens the data into a tabular view.

### Report-Specific logic

Most reports simply use the data as provided in the CWR file. Any reports that have additional logic applied will be listed here:

* **Batch Report**
    * **SPU/SWR grouping**: Publishers are grouped with their writers by sequence, collapsing identical IPNs and recalculating shares on the fly.
    * **OPUÂ â‡„Â OWR pairing**: Since PWRs are optional for OPUs, uncontrolled publishers are matched to writers by order of appearance, filling writer PR share until the publisherâ€™s quota is met.
    * **Additional Columns**: This report contains columns that are not present in CWR files.
* **Cat Import**
    * This report is currenlty in development.

> Want a different aggregation? Fork an existing template or send a feature requestâ€”basic templates are just TypeScript object definitions.

```typescript
{
  id: 'msg-report',
  version: '0.0.2',
  name: 'Message Records',
  description: 'All message records present in the CWR file',
  fields: [
    { key: 'transactionSeqNum', label: 'Tran Seq #', type: 'numeric', width: 75, },
    { key: 'recSeqNum', label: 'Rec Seq #', type: 'numeric', width: 75 },
    { key: 'ogRecSeqNum', label: 'OG Rec Seq #', type: 'numeric', width: 75 },
    { key: 'ogRecType', label: 'OG Rec Type', type: 'string', width: 100 },
    { key: 'msgLevel', label: 'Msg Level', type: 'string', width: 75 },
    { key: 'validationLevel', label: 'Valication Level', type: 'string', width: 100, },
    { key: 'msgText', label: 'Message', type: 'string', width: 900 },
  ],
},
```

## 4Â Â·Â Export

Click **ExportÂ â†’Â CSV** to download the current report. Column headers follow the template spec and data types are preserved (e.g. sequences are considered numeric in the CWR spec and will treated as a number on export).

## Tips & Tricks

* **Keyboard shortcuts**Â â€“ `âŒ˜/^Â +Â f` toggles search, `âŒ˜/^ +Â e`, and `âŒ˜/^ +â€¯k` shows/hides fieldâ€‘info tooltips.
* **CLI** - There is a CLI version of this tool that can handle any file sizes that are too large for your browser.

## Upcoming Features

* **Template diffing**Â â€“ Hover the template name to see its changelog.
* **Errors/Warning View**Â â€“ Click the errors/warnings at the bottom of the report or raw view to see the details.
