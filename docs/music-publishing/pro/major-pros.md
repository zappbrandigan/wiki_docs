## ASCAP: The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers

**Introduction**  
ASCAP, founded in 1914, is the oldest and one of the largest performing rights organizations (PROs) in the United States. Its primary mission is to protect the rights of its members—composers, songwriters, lyricists, and music publishers—by licensing their works for public performance and distributing royalties.

**Role in the Music Business**  
ASCAP collects licensing fees from a wide range of music users, including broadcasters, streaming services, venues, and digital platforms. These fees are then distributed back to its members as royalties, ensuring creators are compensated whenever their music is performed publicly. In 2024, ASCAP collected approximately $1.84 billion in revenue and distributed $1.7 billion in royalties, representing about 1 million members and a registry of 20 million works.

**Film and TV Administration**  
For film and television, ASCAP’s role is centered on the public performance license, which covers the broadcast or streaming of audiovisual content featuring ASCAP music. Filmmakers themselves do not directly obtain these licenses; instead, broadcasters or streaming platforms (e.g., HBO, Netflix) are responsible for securing them. ASCAP also assists filmmakers and composers through its Creative Services Department, providing networking, workshops, and educational opportunities to foster collaboration and talent development in film and TV music.

**Additional Activities**  
Beyond royalty collection, ASCAP provides grants, conducts educational programs, and publishes music catalogs. It has been instrumental in shaping U.S. copyright law and the business of music licensing.

## BMI: Broadcast Music, Inc.

**Introduction**  
BMI was founded in 1939 as an alternative to ASCAP, with a focus on representing songwriters in emerging genres such as jazz, blues, country, and later, rock and roll. Today, BMI is the largest PRO in the United States, representing over 1.4 million songwriters and 22.4 million compositions.

**Role in the Music Business**  
BMI operates by collecting blanket license fees from businesses and organizations that use music publicly, including TV networks, radio stations, digital platforms, and venues. These fees are distributed quarterly to songwriters, composers, and publishers whose works have been performed. In 2022, BMI collected $1.573 billion in revenues and distributed $1.471 billion in royalties.

**Film and TV Administration**  
BMI’s blanket licenses allow film and TV broadcasters to use any song in BMI’s repertoire without negotiating individual licenses for each work. This streamlines the process for broadcasters and ensures that BMI-affiliated composers and publishers are compensated when their music is used in film, television, or streaming. BMI also supports film and TV composers through initiatives like the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theater Workshop, which develops new talent for visual media.

**Additional Activities**  
BMI has a history of supporting underrepresented genres and artists, and it continues to innovate in music rights management and technology. It also plays a significant role in advocacy and career development for its members.

## PRS for Music (UK)

**Introduction**  
PRS for Music, formed in 1997 from the merger of the Performing Right Society (PRS) and the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society (MCPS), is the main music copyright collective in the UK. It represents around 175,000 members, including songwriters, composers, and publishers.

**Role in the Music Business**  
PRS for Music manages the collective rights for the public performance of musical works, collecting royalties whenever music is played or performed publicly. MCPS, as part of PRS for Music, handles mechanical rights, collecting royalties for the reproduction of music in physical and digital formats.

**Film and TV Administration**  
In the context of film and TV, PRS for Music ensures that when music is broadcast, streamed, or performed in audiovisual works, the appropriate royalties are collected and distributed to rights holders. This includes both performance royalties (for public performance/broadcast) and mechanical royalties (for reproductions, such as DVDs or digital downloads). PRS for Music also collaborates with broadcasters and production companies to streamline licensing and compliance, making it easier for filmmakers to use music legally.

**Additional Activities**  
PRS for Music has entered joint ventures (e.g., with Phonographic Performance Limited) to simplify licensing for music users and continues to adapt to changes in the digital and streaming landscape.
