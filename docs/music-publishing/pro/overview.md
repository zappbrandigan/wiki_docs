# Performing Rights Organizations (PROs)

Performing Rights Organizations (PROs) are entities that help songwriters, composers, and music publishers get paid when their music is publicly performed. This includes performances on radio, television, streaming services, live concerts, and even in businesses like restaurants or retail stores.

## What Do PROs Do?

PROs manage and enforce **public performance rights**, which are one of the six exclusive rights granted to copyright holders under U.S. law.

Their responsibilities include:
- **Collecting royalties** from businesses and platforms that play music
- **Distributing those royalties** to registered rights holders (writers and publishers)
- **Issuing licenses** to music users (radio stations, venues, streaming services, etc.)

## How Do They Pay Royalties?

PROs use data from radio spins, digital streams, live performance reports, TV cue sheets, and blanket licenses to calculate payments. Each PRO has a different method for determining how much each song earns and when payments are distributed.

- ASCAP: Quarterly payments, survey + census methods
- BMI: Quarterly payments, weighted sampling
- SESAC: Monthly or quarterly (private system)
