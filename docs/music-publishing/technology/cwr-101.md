Common Works Registration (CWR) is the global standard for batch registering musical works with Collective Management Organizations (CMOs) outside the US and Canada. In North America, most publishers use Electronic Batch Registration (EBR) files—simple .xls spreadsheets—accepted by PROs like ASCAP, BMI, and SOCAN. However, CMOs abroad require CWR files: specially formatted text files that follow a strict, but inconsistently implemented, specification.

### EBR vs. CWR: Key Differences
- **EBR**: Used in the US/Canada, accessible as Excel files, easy for most publishers.
- **CWR**: Required by most international CMOs, must be formatted as plain text (usually with a `.v21` suffix for version 2.1), and is much more complex.

### Why CWR Is Challenging
- Each CMO has unique data and formatting requirements, so a file that works for one may be rejected by another.
- Most publishers lack the tools to export valid CWR files. Even commercial software like Vistex's Music Maestro may not meet every CMO's needs.
- Clean, complete, and accurate metadata is essential—errors or missing data will cause rejections.

### Tools for Creating CWR Files
- **Music Maestro**: Can export CWR, but may not meet all CMO requirements.

### Best Practices for CWR Success
- **Unique Submitter Work ID**: Each work must have a unique ID in your database, included in the CWR file.
- **Publisher-Writer Relationships**: Every controlled publisher must be linked to at least one writer in each work registration.
- **Agreement IDs**: Many foreign societies require society-assigned agreement IDs to identify publishing agreements. For ICE societies (PRS, STIM, GEMA, etc.), these IDs are mandatory and must be included.
- **Accurate Party Data**: All party names and IPI numbers (for writers and publishers) must be correct and included.
- **Territory Codes**: Specify all relevant territories as required by each CMO (e.g., APRA requires explicit inclusion/exclusion of Australia, NZ, etc.).
- **Allowed Characters**: Only use characters permitted by each CMO (e.g., commas are allowed in titles but not publisher names; accented characters are restricted).

### The Registration Process
1. **Submit CWR File**: Send your CWR file to the CMO.
2. **Receive ACK File**: The CMO returns an acknowledgement (ACK) file listing accepted and rejected works. Rejections include (sometimes unclear) explanations.
3. **Revise and Resubmit**: Fix errors, update your data, and resubmit as needed. The Submitter Work ID is used to track revisions.

### Data Quality Is Critical
- Clean, validated data is essential for successful registrations. Incomplete or incorrect metadata leads to rejections and lost royalties.
- Building royalty admin tools: allocate plenty of time for CWR/EBR export development and ongoing testing—each CMO interprets the standard differently, so expect trial and error.

**Summary:**
- CWR is the international standard for batch work registration, but is complex and inconsistently enforced.
- Use the right tools, maintain clean data, and be prepared for ongoing troubleshooting.
- Proper CWR/EBR exports are essential for global royalty collection and music publishing success.
