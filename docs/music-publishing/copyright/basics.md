|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Composition**      | Songwriter & Publisher      | Melody, lyrics, sheet music               |
| **Sound Recording**  | Recording Artist & Label     | Actual recorded performance               |

## Do You Need to Register?

In the U.S., copyright exists **automatically** upon creation, but registration with the **U.S. Copyright Office** is necessary to:

- Collect statutory damages and legal fees
- Create a public record of ownership

## How Long Does It Last?

- **Post-1978 works**: Life of the author + 70 years
