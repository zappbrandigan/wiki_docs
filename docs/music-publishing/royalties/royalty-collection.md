# Global Publishing Royalty Collection

*Who actually pays songwriters and publishers?* And *how does that money get tracked and delivered across the globe?*

The answer starts with understanding **royalty pay sources** — organizations and platforms responsible for tracking, collecting, and distributing income earned when music is played, sold, or streamed. One of the most important types of pay sources are **collection societies**, which form the foundation of global royalty administration.

Each pay source works a little differently based on:

* The **type of royalty** they manage (performance, mechanical, etc.),
* The **region** they operate in,
* And their **organizational structure** (nonprofit, for-profit, government-backed, etc.).

| Acronym | Term | Royalty Type |
|---------|------|--------------|
|CMO      |Collective Management Organization|Performance and/or Mechanical Royalties|
|PRO      |Performing Rights Organization| Performance Royalties|
|MRO      |Mechanical Rights Organization| Mechanical Royalties|
|RAE      |Rights Administrator Entity| Mechanical and Performance Royalties|
|DSP      |Digital Service Provider|Mechanical and Performance Royalties|

Here is a break down the most common types of royalty sources.

### Collective Management Organizations (CMOs)

These nonprofit organizations license, track, and collect royalties on behalf of songwriters and publishers. They’re usually **territory-specific** (e.g., by country or region), and tend to focus on either **performance** or **mechanical** royalties.

Most CMOs have **open membership** policies and are **owned by their members**, meaning songwriters and publishers can usually join directly. You’ll encounter CMOs across the globe in your admin work — whether handling international registrations or researching royalty sources.

### Performing Rights Organizations (PROs)

PROs are a specific type of CMO focused solely on **performance royalties** — money earned when a song is played publicly, such as:

* On the radio or TV,
* In a bar, restaurant, or venue,
* Or through a streaming service.

U.S. examples include **ASCAP**, **BMI**, **SESAC**, and **GMR**. Each one has slightly different rules, but in general:

* The **writer’s share** of royalties is paid directly to the songwriter.
* The **publisher’s share** may require a registered publishing entity (depending on the PRO).

When supporting a songwriter or publisher through a PRO registration, it’s important to know whether the publisher share needs its own account or entity to receive payment.

### Mechanical Rights Organizations (MROs)

MROs handle **mechanical royalties**, which come from the reproduction of songs — such as digital downloads, streams, or physical copies (CDs, vinyl).

In some countries, **PROs and MROs are separate**, and you’ll need to coordinate with both to ensure complete royalty coverage. Examples include:

* **The Mechanical Licensing Collective (The MLC)** — works directly with songwriters in the U.S.
* **Harry Fox Agency (HFA)** — requires a third-party publisher or personal publishing entity to register on behalf of the songwriter.

An admin may need to communicate with one or both of these organizations.

### Rights Administration Entities (RAEs)

RAEs are **for-profit** businesses that collect and distribute royalties in a similar way to CMOs, but they operate under different rules. Unlike CMOs, RAEs:

* Can be selective about whom they work with,
* Are **privately owned**, and
* Typically partner with publishers or rights holders directly.

A common example is **Music Reports (MRI)** in the U.S., which handles licensing and royalty distribution for several large digital platforms and television networks.

### Digital Service Providers (DSPs)

**DSPs** like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, and Deezer are where the public streams or downloads songs. These services:

* Generate both **performance** and **mechanical** royalties,
* Work with **distributors** to ingest and host music,
* And usually report royalty earnings to CMOs, RAEs, or large publishers.

Some major publishers have direct relationships with DSPs, while others rely on administrators to manage and track this data.

### Affiliation and Registration

* A writer **affiliates** with a pay source, the writer receives an **IPI** number
* Once a song is registered, an ISWC is issued for that work
* When the recorded form of the work is distributed, ISRC(s) is issued for that work

In order to ensure maximum collection, works need to be registered directly with relevant pay sources in each territory where the music is used.

### Why This Matters

The role of an administrative team member might involve:

* Assisting with **song registrations** at PROs, MROs, or CMOs,
* Verifying client accounts and royalty statements,
* Resolving conflicts or payment issues between pay sources,
* Or helping onboard new clients with publishing entity setup.
