# Mechanical Royalties

**Mechanical royalties** are payments to songwriters and publishers whenever a song is reproduced or distributed â€” digitally or physically. They are distinct from performance royalties, and stem from the **mechanical right**, one of the six exclusive rights under copyright law.

## When Are Mechanical Royalties Generated?

- Physical sales (CDs, vinyl)
- Digital downloads (iTunes, Bandcamp)
- Interactive streaming (Spotify, Apple Music)
- Ringtones, karaoke tracks, etc.

:::note

Non-interactive streaming (like Pandora) typically does *not* generate mechanical royalties.
