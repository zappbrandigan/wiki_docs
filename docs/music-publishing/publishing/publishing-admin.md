# Publishing Administration

**Publishing administration** refers to the business function of managing, registering, licensing, and collecting royalties for musical compositions on behalf of the songwriter or composer.

It is **not** the same as owning publishing rights — a publishing administrator doesn’t take copyright ownership.
