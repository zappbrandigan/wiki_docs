# Understanding Publishing Agreements

For most music creators, the ultimate goal isn’t just getting their songs heard — it’s turning their creativity into a sustainable livelihood.

That’s where music publishers and publishing administrators come in. These entities help songwriters get paid for the use of their compositions by collecting royalties from sources all over the world. Depending on the type of deal a writer has, a publisher might also assist with registering songs, licensing opportunities, or creative support.

Now, let’s walk through the four most common publishing deal types you’ll encounter.

### Administration Agreements

These deals are most common with independent songwriters who want to retain full ownership of their copyrights. In an administration agreement:

* The songwriter retains 100% of the writer’s share **and** 100% ownership of their publisher’s share.
* The administrator collects royalties on the songwriter’s behalf, registers their works globally, and resolves conflicts or metadata issues.
* In return, the administrator typically earns a fee of 15–25% of the *publisher’s share* only.
* The songwriter maintains full creative and sync control.
* These agreements are often flexible — for example, clients can opt out after just one year.

Administration deals *do not* typically include creative services like A\&R or pitching songs for sync unless explicitly stated.

This is a great option for writers who want help with the business side of publishing but want to stay independent creatively.

### Traditional and Co-Publishing Agreements

These are more comprehensive agreements often offered to songwriters with commercial potential or industry momentum.

* In a **traditional** deal, the publisher receives 100% of the publisher’s share and takes full administrative and creative control in return for providing services like licensing, pitching, co-writing opportunities, and royalty collection.

* In a **co-publishing** deal, the writer keeps 100% of their writer’s share and typically 50% of their publisher’s share — a total of 75% of the total royalties.

These deals may come with **advances**, giving songwriters upfront money in exchange for the future income from their songs. However, advances must be recouped by the publisher before the writer begins receiving additional royalties.

**Key responsibilities for administrators**:

* Ensure proper royalty tracking and recoupment accounting.
* Support communication with PROs and societies.
* Help explain the writer’s rights and obligations under the deal terms.

These agreements often last several years and may come with creative obligations, such as delivering a certain number of commercial songs.

### Work-for-Hire Agreements

In this arrangement, the songwriter is paid a flat fee to create a song but does **not** retain any ownership — neither the master nor the publishing rights. In some cases, they may not even be credited as the composer.

This kind of deal:

* Is usually project-specific (e.g., music for a film, ad, or client brief).
* Transfers full rights to the hiring party.
* Can be a valuable short-term income source or career-building opportunity for emerging writers.

Administrators should help ensure that:

* All terms are clearly documented.
* Writers understand what they are relinquishing.
* Any royalties due (if applicable) are tracked appropriately.

### Exclusive Songwriter Agreements

Also known as “staff writer” deals, these agreements commit the songwriter to working exclusively with one publisher for a set period.

* The publisher receives 100% of the publisher’s share for all works written during the contract.
* The writer typically receives regular advance payments (weekly, monthly, or quarterly), which are recouped from future royalties.

This structure provides songwriters with financial stability and allows publishers to take a more active role in the writer’s career development.

For administrators, this means:

* Ongoing royalty accounting and recoupment tracking.
* Ensuring proper registration of all works created during the agreement.
* Coordinating closely with the publisher’s creative team.

Because this type of deal is resource-intensive, it’s typically reserved for writers who have already shown strong commercial potential.
