Like many who end up working behind the scenes in entertainment, I\u2019ve had to pick up a lot on the fly. As I learn the ins and outs of music publishing on the job, I\u2019ve been organizing what I\u2019ve found helpful, confusing, or just worth remembering into notes, guides, and tools \u2014 and adding them here.\\n\\nWhether you\u2019re new to music publishing, trying to automate a few tedious workflows, or just curious about how it all fits together, I hope this site helps make things a bit clearer.\\n\\nThanks for stopping by!"}]}}')}}]);
