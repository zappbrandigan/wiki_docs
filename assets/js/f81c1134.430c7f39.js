This makes it easier to distinguish between international versions of a film or series at a glance\u2014especially helpful for teams handling global metadata.\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udd01 Alternative Titles Copy-Paste Fix\\n\\nPreviously, copying alternative titles would result in the order being scrambled or inconsistent. That\u2019s now fixed. The tool preserves the display order exactly as shown when copying, so what you see is what you get.\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udd17 IMDb Code Copy Trimmed to Last 9 Characters\\n\\nI\'ve cleaned up the IMDb code copy behavior. Instead of copying the full URL or extra characters, it now smartly copies just the last 9-character IMDb ID (e.g.,tt12345678 -> t12345678)\u2014perfect for pasting into internal systems.
